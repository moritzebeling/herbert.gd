# [herbert.gd](https://herbert.gd)
An archive website for the graphic design and visual communication department at Bauhaus-University Weimar, Germany.

## Contributions welcome
If you want to contribute to the website design and functionality or fix problems, feel free to get in touch, open an issue or create a pull request. Read more below at branching.

If you want to contribute to the page content, please get in touch with the editors aka. the staff of the graphic design chair at Marienstra√üe 1, Weimar. Read more at [herbert.gd/info](https://herbert.gd/info).

## Setup
The website runs on PHP and uses Kirby as CMS, framework and templating engine. On top of that, there is a Svelte frontend JS framework to dynamically render and manipulate lists of posts on client side. It fetches json data from a public api that can be accessed by appending `.json` at the end of any page url.
CSS is not bundled by Svelte, but compiled with Sass.
All content is lives on the live server. Get in touch to get a copy of that.
